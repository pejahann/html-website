    <!-- This is Yatoro -->
    <h1>1. Yatoro</h1>
    <img src="Images/YATORO.jpg" alt="Yator"> 
    <p>Illya <span style="color: cyan;">"Yatoro"</span> Mulyarchuk (also known as Raddan) (born March 12, 2003) is a Ukrainian player who is currently playing for Team Spirit.</p>
    <p>Yatoro began his professional career in 2019, playing in various small tournaments in his region such as Epic Origins League Season 1 and Isolation Cup. He joined Yellow Submarine in 2020, which was in the process of being rebuilt with relatively-unknown talent. The team became one of the most promising in the region during COVID-hit 2020, including 4th in DOTA Summit 13 Online: Europe & CIS, and the roster was eventually signed by Team Spirit.</p>
    <p>Valve announced the return of the Dota Pro Circuit in 2021, and Team Spirit established themselves as a contending team behind regional titans Virtus.pro and teams with established rosters such as Natus Vincere and AS Monaco Gambit. The team's performances granted them their first LAN as a team in the WePlay Animajor, where they finished 7th-8th. Team Spirit, however, failed to obtain enough DPC points to qualify for The International 2021, and thus were forced to go through the regional qualifiers. In the Grand Finals, they were taken to a game 5 against Team Empire, eventually winning and qualifying.</p>
    <p>At The International 2021, Team Spirit were not favoured to go far in the tournament, with teams such as PSG.LGD and Evil Geniuses having done better in international competitions. Team Spirit started disastrously, losing their series against Team Secret, PSG.LGD and Vici Gaming in convincing fashion, and only picking up a win against Elephant. They recovered in days 3 and 4, however, going 6-0 against Quincy Crew, Fnatic, and beastcoast, securing themselves a place in the Upper Bracket. Mira[1] shaved Yatoro's head on day 4, which he joked as being "a sacrifice to the god of Dota".[2]</p>
    <p>In the Main Event, they were sent to the Lower Bracket immediately by Invictus Gaming, but grew stronger as time went on, reaching the Grand Final through the Lower Bracket. Yatoro himself played 14 heroes in over 20 games in the Main Event, showcasing not only his ability but his versatility. In the Grand Finals, he and Team Spirit upset the odds by beating PSG.LGD in a tense 5-game series, securing themselves the Aegis and over US$18m in prize money.</p>
    
    <!-- This is Topson -->
    <h1>2. Topson</h1>
    <img src="Images/TOPSON.jpg" alt="Topson">
    <p>Topias <span style="color: cyan;">"Topson"</span> Taavitsainen (born April 14, 1998) is a Finnish player who is currently playing for Tundra Esports.</p>
    <p>Topson was born in Haukipudas, Finland. He has seven older siblings and four younger siblings.[1] He began playing Dota when he was 8 years old after being encouraged by his brothers.</p>
    <p>His professional career began in 2017 with brief stints at SFTe-sports and 5 Anchors No Captain, and he represented his country at WESG 2017.</p>
    <p>His high leaderboard ranking subesquently attracted attention, and in June 2018 he was announced as the new midlaner for OG prior to The International 2018 regional qualifiers. OG qualified for the event and, despite low expectations at the start of the tournament, lifted the aegis after defeating PSG.LGD in the grand final.</p>
    <p>On August 25th, 2019, he became the first two time TI-Winner, after winning two consecutive TIs, TI8 and TI9. He achieved this together with his teammates N0tail, Ceb, ana, and JerAx on OG. After placing 7th-8th in The International 2021, he took a break from the competitive scene. He joined T1 as last minute stand-in for The International 2022 qualifiers but didn't manage to qualify. He later form a team named Old G with former teammates Ceb and N0tail but the team didn't manage to qualify to division 1. He would later play for Tundra Esports at The International 2023, replacing Saksa who went inactive due to health reasons.[2][3]</p>

    <!-- This is SumaiL -->
    <h1>3. SumaiL</h1>
    <img src="Images/SUMAIL.jpg" alt="SumaiL">
    <p>Sumail <span style="color: cyan;">"SumaiL"</span> Hassan (born February 13, 1999) is a Pakistani/American player who is currently playing for Nigma Galaxy.</p>
    <p>Sumail was born in Karachi, Pakistan. He started playing Dota when he was eight years old. When his family moved from Pakistan to Rosemont, Illinois in 2012 he began playing in the North American Elite League. Sumail quickly became the highest rated player in the in-house league, establishing himself as one of the best upcoming talents in the North American scene.[1] His play was so impressive that UNiVeRsE pushed for EG to recruit him in January 2015. Sumail's LAN debut was at the Dota 2 League Season 5 finals in Las Vegas on January 6th 2015. The team performed poorly at the event, in part to lack luster performance by Sumail. Critics began to question whether he deserved a roster spot on a team like Evil Geniuses.</p>
    <p>In February, Sumail would get a chance to redeem himself as EG participated in the Dota 2 Asia Championships. In his first match of the tournament, Sumail introduced his Euls Scepter of Divinity Shadow Fiend build, which would quickly become part of the meta for the tournament. EG's captain ppd entered the tournament with a focus on drafting around Sumail, in order to ensure he was comfortable in game. This proved to be quite successful as EG found themselves in the top 4, with an 11-4 record, after the group stage. EG stormed through the upper bracket beating Na'Vi and Big God, but were soundly defeated 2-0 by VG in the upper bracket finals. After a 2-0 victory over the tournament favorite Team Secret in the lower bracket finals, EG had a rematch with VG in the finals. In the finals Sumail established himself as one of the best mid players in the world with his stellar play. Sumail's most notable performance of the tournament was in Game 3 of the finals, where he found himself with a 0-3-0 score on Storm Spirit before the three minute mark. Undeterred by the poor start, Sumail quickly took control of the game and led his team to victory, while finishing with a score of 17-7-11. Sumail's breakout performance at DAC led to widespread recognition as a young prodigy in both the Chinese and Western Dota scenes, and secured a reputation as one of the best Storm Spirit players in the game. Sumail helped EG establish themselves as the best team in the beginning of 2015, along with securing $1,284,158 USD for the team.</p>
    <p>EG entered The International 2015 as one of the two favorites along with Team Secret; EG had finished 2nd behind Secret at each of the previous two LAN tournaments, The Summit 3 and ESL One Frankfurt 2015. Team Secret finished in 8th place, leaving the way to the championship open for EG. However, EG experienced a setback of their own after losing the Upper Bracket Finals 0-2 to the surprise wildcard powerhouse CDEC Gaming. EG defeated LGD Gaming in the Lower Bracket Finals and prevailed 3-1 in a rematch with CDEC in the Grand Finals to claim the International 2015 championship. Sumail's play was particularly noteworthy in both the Lower Bracket Finals and the Grand Finals - Game 1 of the Grand Finals was eerily reminiscent of Sumail's experience in DAC, as Sumail died 3 times on his signature Storm Spirit in the opening moments of the game, but proceeded to complete the fastest Orchid Malevolence on a Storm Spirit across the entire tournament. EG took home $6,634,661 for their first-place finish, making Sumail the youngest player ever to surpass $1 million in esports winnings.[2]</p>
    <p>Following the tournament saw the departure of Aui_2000 for Arteezy. He finished second place in the MLG 2015 World Finals and came third in Valve's inaugural announcement of the Majors system, the Frankfurt Major 2015, losing to potential champions, OG in the lower bracket finals. Ending the 2015 calendar year, ppd's decision to draft the Shadow Fiend for sumaiL in the grand finals of the The Summit 4 saw the team making an eventual comeback of 3-2, winning the tournament.</p>
    <p>In 2016, SumaiL started off in a slow start and finished third in the Shanghai Major. However, after numerous roster changes throughout the year saw his team exit in the early stages of premier tournaments. After the announcement of being directly invited to The International 2016, saw a roster change to occur with the addition of Zai and Universe, causing the team to have to play in the open qualifiers. After qualifying, he attended The International 2016 for the second successive time under Evil Geniuses and came third place in the tournament. After the extended post-TI break, he travelled to China to compete in the MDL Autumn 2016 and came first place.[3]</p>
    
    <!-- This is Miracle- -->
    <h1>4. Miracle-</h1>
    <img src="Images/MIRACLE.jpg" alt="Miracle">
    <p>Amer <span style="color: cyan;">"Miracle-"</span> Al-Barkawi (born June 20, 1997) is a Jordanian/Polish player who is currently playing for Nigma Galaxy.</p>
    <p>Miracle- was born to a Polish mother and Jordanian father. He holds dual citizenship.</p>
    <p>Miracle- began playing DotA: Allstars at a young age in Jordan.[1] A now-famous replay shows a 13-year-old Miracle- playing Shadow Fiend against a team with MISERY, demonstrating a high degree of skill despite his team losing.[2][3]</p>
    <p>Miracle- joined Balkan Bears at the beginning of 2015, only to be removed from the team about four months later. While he was teamless, he began gaining recognition in the European scene by climbing the matchmaking rating leaderboards in pub games. Miracle- eventually became the #1 player by MMR in the European division and the world, surpassing w33.</p>
    <p>After achieving the #1 MMR ranking, he was invited by N0tail to join (monkey) Business, a new team formed from the post-TI5 reshuffle to compete in the upcoming Majors. The team reformed as OG after being sponsored.</p>
    <p>OG qualified for the first ever Dota 2 Major, the Frankfurt Major and managed to win the tournament in an unexpected series of upsets, with Miracle- showing high level performances on Shadow Fiend throughout the tournament. His impressive abilities prompted many other teams to respect ban the hero. After the Frankfurt Major, Miracle- later won numerous tournaments with OG during mid 2016, such as DreamLeague Season 5 and ESL Frankfurt 2016, while also claiming his second Valve Major win at the Manila Major[4]. Despite OG being one of the favorites for winning The International 2016, they exited early in the tournament, losing to TnC Gaming in the second round of the lower brackets at the main stage, marking one of the biggest upsets in Dota 2 history.[5]</p>
    <p>Following the International 2016, he departed the team and joined Team Liquid after FATA- announced his temporary break from professional Dota[6][7]. The new competitive season would start slow for Miracle- and his new team, when they failed to qualify for the Boston Major. However, after his friend GH joined the team early 2017, having already stood in for them during their victory at DreamLeague, Team Liquid found their way back to dominance at the top of competitive Dota 2. Together with his team, Miracle- went on to win several premier tournaments throughout 2017: StarSeries Season 3, StarLadder i-League Invitational #2, EPICENTER, and DreamLeague Season 7. Miracle-'s outstanding season culminated in his team's victory at The International 2017[8], where Team Liquid swept Newbee 3-0 in the Grand Finals.</p>

    <!-- This is ana -->
    <h1>5. ana</h1>
    <img src="Images/ANA.jpg" alt="ana">
    <p>Anathan <span style="color: cyan;">"ana"</span> Pham (born October 27, 1999) is an inactive Australian player who last played for T1.</p>
    <p>While initially playing Dota in Australia, ana made the decision to move from Melbourne to Shanghai in December 2015 to continue his pursuit in becoming a professional Dota player, where he joined the CDEC in-house league allowing him to compete against highly rated Chinese players. The invitation to play in China saw him drop out of his high school, where his mother was half-supportive at first, however with Anathan's brother convincing her, the family later showed full support and still do to this day.[1][2]</p>
    <p>Ana began his professional Dota 2 career by joining Invictus Gaming in March 2016 as a substitute for Ferrari_430.[3] His most notable accomplishment with the team was defeating Newbee in the grand finals of NEA 2016. Following The International 2016, ana left Invictus Gaming to join a newly rebuilt OG.[4] It was later revealed that his departure from Invictus Gaming was due to a rift with their organisation's management with their contract and other factors involving their results.[1][5][6] In November, he won his first ever tournament with OG at Elimination Mode Season 2 and later won his first ever Valve and premier event by beating Ad Finem 3-1 in the grand finals of The Boston Major.</p>
    <p>The team's performance continued to stay consistent with additional top 4 performances at Dota Pit League Season 5, StarLadder i-League StarSeries Season 3, and Dota 2 Asia Championships 2017. Ana would then take his second major at Kiev, and the team was invited for The International 2017. OG's had a rough series of tournaments leading up to the International with early eliminations at The Manila Masters and EPICENTER 2017, however, they did finish fourth at Mars Dota 2 League 2017. During the International, the team failed to make it to the upper bracket, and finished 7 - 8th, falling at the hands of LGD. After the International, ana announced that he would be taking a break from the competitive scene.[7][8] Following his break, he later joined Echo International in early 2018, and returned to OG in early June, after the departure of Fly and S4.</p>
    <p>The newly re-formed OG roster of ana, N0tail, Topson, 7ckngMad, and Jerax qualified to The International 2018 through the European open qualifiers. Although they were power-ranked at the bottom among the 18 teams participating, OG pushed through the Upper Bracket and won the Grand Finals against LGD Gaming in a 3-2 series. Notably, Ana's dominating performance on Ember Spirit in game 5 immortalized his signature mastery on the hero. Following their achievement, Ana announced he would be taking an extended break from DotA and was moved to OG's inactive roster [9], and was a substitute at AMD Pro Series 2018 in December 2018, playing in his home country.</p>
    <p>He returned to the active team in March 2019, after a few months off as OG was struggling yet again to achieve any significant results. With ana back on the roster, OG were finally able to secure a qualifier for a major: the MDL Disneyland Paris Major. A 5-6th-place finish, after being eliminated by Team Liquid, awarded them enough DPC points to make it into the top 12 of the DPC. They were as good as qualified for The International 2019, though not yet mathematically. By qualifying and finishing top 8 at the final major of the season, the EPICENTER Major, their ticket to TI9 was secured.</p>
    <p>After easily topping their group at TI9, without dropping a single series, OG easily made it to the upper bracket of the main event. This would be almost a repeat compared to the previous year: OG beat Newbee (who were almost the same roster as the previous year's VGJ.Storm) 2-0, Evil Geniuses 2-1, and in the UB finals they again beat PSG.LGD 2-1. The only difference this year was that nobody underestimated OG and they entered the Grand Finals as heavy favorites, with some experts going so far as to predicting the second 3-0 sweep in TI history. Especially ana's carry Io, Alchemist, and Faceless Void drew a lot of respect from their opponents. In the end, OG beat Team Liquid 3-1, making ana and his teammates the first ever repeat TI winners.</p>
    <p>Ana would once again enter the inactive roster of OG after securing TI9, starting his break in January of 2020. He had a brief return to the team during the Spring DPC season in April 2021, replacing MidOne. Unfortunately, after lackluster results and failing to qualify for the season's Major, he would annouce his retirement from the competitive scene on June 14, 2021.[10] N0tail would later cite that ana "burnt out" and lost motivation.[11]</p>
    <p>Despite his formal retirement, ana has played for Team Liquid, Royal Never Give Up and T1, during Riyadh Masters 2022, PGL Arlington Major 2022, The International 2022 SEA Qualifiers and The International 2022 Last Chance Qualifier.[12][13]</p>

    <!-- This is Arteezy -->
    <h1>6. Arteezy</h1>
    <img src="Images/ARTEEZY.jpg" alt="rtz">
    <p>Artour <span style="color: cyan;">"Arteezy"</span> Babaev (also known as 天鸽) (born July 1, 1996) is a Canadian/Uzbek player who is currently playing for Shopify Rebellion.</p>
    <p>Artour was born in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, to Uzbek parents of Russian and Armenian ancestry,[1][2] and moved to Canada at the age of 2. He used to speak Russian at home, but due to a lack of practice, can now only understand spoken Russian, and cannot speak nor write it.[3] Before playing Dota 2 professionally he played the original DotA as well as Starcraft II. Arteezy played Protoss, and reached Masters before he started playing Dota 2.[4]</p>
    <p>Due to his young age and commitment to his studies, Arteezy had postponed any plans to play Dota 2 professionally. In April 2013, Arteezy finally committed to a team and joined Kaipi for the summer, along with ComeWithMe.[5] However, after just four months Arteezy left the team and went inactive in order to once again focus on his studies.[6] In September 2013, Artour joined Take Five, a casual team of ringers, in order to participate in RaidCall EMS ONE Fall Americas, which the team would go on to win. Shortly after, Take Five disbanded and Arteezy would again be inactive. On November 22, 2013 Arteezy had the opportunity to stand in for bOne7 and play for his previous team Speed Gaming (formerly Kaipi) at MLG Columbus. Arteezy handily defeated several elite mid-laners, including Mushi and Dendi, en route to an underdog victory for Speed Gaming over Team DK in the finals. This victory at the first LAN event Artour ever attended garnered a great deal of attention, including 7ckngMad's infamous comments on Artour's skill.[7]</p>
    <p>On January 31st, 2014, Arteezy, along with legendary North American Dota players UNiVeRsE and Fear, as well as former HoN players ppd and zai created S A D B O Y S, which had immediate success. The team won sixteen out of their first eighteen matches, including winning the Electronic Sports Prime/Shock Therapy Cup while going undefeated. On February 21st, 2014, Arteezy and company were announced to be the new Evil Geniuses Dota 2 squad.[8] This would mark the first time that Arteezy would fully commit to a team for the long term. On March 7th 2014 the new EG made their LAN debut at the Monster Energy Invitational, where they won 3-2 against Cloud9 in the finals. With this victory the team quickly began to establish their reputation as one of the best teams in the world, due in no small part to Artour's dominant play in the middle lane on heroes such as Dragon Knight, Naga Siren, and Razor. On April 29th Arteezy and his EG teammates were directly invited to compete in The International 2014. With top 3 finishes at three of the four major LANs prior to TI4, including a first place finish at The Summit 1 over team DK, EG was one of the favorites to win the biggest tournament of the year. At TI4 Evil Geniuses had a strong performance in the group stage placing second with an 11-4 record. In the main event EG would beat Team DK but fall to Newbee in the upper bracket. In the lower bracket finals EG would face off against Vici Gaming. The final game of the series was a decisive loss for EG, causing many people to question Arteezy's decision to pick up a late Hand of Midas.[9] Artour and EG ended up going home with a 3rd place finish and $1,038,416 USD.</p>
    <p>On January 6th, 2015, it was announced that Arteezy had joined Team Secret and he would now be playing the hard carry role.[10][11] With the addition of Artour, as well as zai, Team Secret was now seen as an all-star caliber team and was lauded as the best team in the world. The Dota 2 Asia Championships was Team Secret's tournament debut, and they quickly stormed through the group stage finishing with a 15-0 record behind solid play from Artour on his signature heroes Shadow Fiend and Lycan. Secret could not ride this momentum through the upper bracket though, as they were defeated 2-1 by Vici Gaming in the upper bracket semi-finals. Secret would then face Big God in the lower bracket semi-finals and prevail with a score of 2-1. In the lower bracket finals Artour would be defeated by his former team Evil Geniuses by a score of 2-0. Team Secret would rebound from their 3rd place finish at DAC by winning four straight tournaments: Redbull Battle Grounds: Dota 2, The Summit 3, MarsTV Dota 2 League 2015 Spring, and ESL One Frankfurt 2015. Artour would get his revenge over EG as Team Secret defeated them 3-1 in the finals of both The Summit 3 and ESL One Frankfurt 2015. With these remarkable results Team Secret was considered the best team heading into The International 2015. Following a disappointing performance at The International 2015, Arteezy left Team Secret to rejoin Evil Geniuses as the hard carry player.[12] Arteezy's second spell on Evil Geniuses was marked by consistent results with EG finishing in the top 3 of 5 consecutive LAN events. Despite this consistency they were unable to achieve many tournament wins with their only success coming at The Summit 4. This win also meant that Arteezy became the first 3 time Summit champion as he had won the first and third iterations of the tournament with EG and Team Secret respectively. Following the Dotapit Season 4 event, where EG lost 3-0 in the grand finals, it was announced that Arteezy had once again left EG to join Team Secret bringing UNiVeRsE with him. Arteezy returned to playing the mid role for Secret which he had not played regularly since his first stint in EG.</p>
    <p>After poor results in The International 2016, he later departed Team Secret. On September 15th, 2016, Arteezy returned to Evil Geniuses, once again playing the carry role.[13]</p>

    <!-- This is JerAx -->
    <h1>7. JerAx</h1>
    <img src="Images/JERAX.jpg" alt="jerAx">
    <p>Jesse <span style="color: cyan;">"JerAx"</span> Vainikka (born May 7, 1992) is a Finnish Dota 2 two-time The International Champion with OG, who last coached Team Liquid before retiring from professional Dota 2.</p>
    <p>JerAx made his name in Heroes of Newerth, where he played for a number of teams including "Dirty Minds" (with Era and SingSing) and "Man the fuck Up"/"KD-Gaming" (with Era).[1] He then did a compulsory military service in the Finnish navy, and when he had finished it, started playing Dota 2.[1]</p>
    <p>On the 15th January 2018, JerAx unveiled his own merchandise website JerAx.GG.[2]</p>
    <p>JerAx began his Dota 2 career in the Finnish team Rat in the dark as a support player. After playing with them for a month he was approached by SingSing, and JerAx joined his team, QPAD Red Pandas as a trialist. A while later he was announced as a full member of the team.[1]</p>
    <p>After more than a year of absence from the Dota 2 professional scene, JerAx became a part of the newly formed Finnish squad 4 Anchors + Sea Captain alongside Trixi, MATUMBAMAN, Vaalix and Buugi. JerAx played the #4 position for the team, in addition to serving as the overall team captain and drafter. He left the team in early January 2015.[3]</p>
    <p>A few days later, JerAx joined the international team Team Tinker. After a couple months of disappointing results, JerAx parted ways with the team on March 6th, and was announced to be joining Korean team MVP HOT6ix. The team quickly became a powerhouse in the South East Asia scene, and after winning MPGL Season 7, the team qualified for The International 2015. Despite their strong play leading up to the tournament, MVP HOT6ix disappointed at the main event. They finished last in their group, and were knocked out in the first round of the playoffs by Invictus Gaming.</p>
    <p>In the post TI5 shuffle, JerAx left MVP HOT6ix, and was revealed to have joined 5Jungz after the team was invited to the ESL One New York 2015 European Qualifiers. After a string of good results, he was picked up by Team Liquid. With winning The Defense Season 5 and reaching third place at WCA 2015, JerAx ended the 2015 calendar year on a high note.</p>
    <p>JerAx continued his good form over the new year with double runner-up places in the Frankfurt and Manila majors respectively. With a consistent run of being second, JerAx won his first premier offline tournament in 2016 at EPICENTER. Liquid was invited to The International 2016, which would be JerAx's second TI attendance, where they finished top 8, after falling to Fnatic.</p>
    <p>He left Team Liquid during the post-TI shuffle,[4] to join rivals OG.[5] The move would prove to be very rewarding, as he became a Major champion with a victory at the Boston Major. It would be his third showing in a Major Grand Final.</p>
    <p>In April 2017, JerAx and OG came second at DAC 2017, falling 0-3 to Invictus Gaming in the Grand Finals. Despite this loss, the team came back with a vengeance at the second and final Major of the season, the Kiev Major, beating Virtus.pro 3-2 in a nail-biting series. Another top 8 finish at his third International would prove to be disappointing, as his team was heavily favored to win.</p>
    <p>Despite this, he would continue on with OG for the upcoming season. However, after the departure of their carry ana, OG's performance in the new season dropped immensely and the team would fail to qualify to a number of Majors and Minors. Victory at MDL Macau would be the only notable achievement for the remaining year.</p>
    <p>Despite a marked improvement in qualifiers, results at LAN tournaments were still a far cry away from the previous season and were further marred by his team's roster troubles. Following another disappointing early exit at ESL One Birmingham, JerAx's teammates Fly and s4 shockingly left the team to join a similarly struggling Evil Geniuses.</p>
    <p>With only a few months left before qualifiers for The International 2018, JerAx together with his remaining teammates, coach-turned-player Ceb and OG co-founder N0tail, were forced to scrape together a roster. They managed to bring back ana to the team and also recruited JerAx's countryman Topson, who was a well known as a pubstar with little to no professional experience to date. OG would take the European qualifier spot, but little was expected of the young roster, many even going so far as ranking the team last among the field of contenders.</p>
    <p>However, JerAx and his team overcame all odds. After barely securing an upper bracket berth, the team cruised to the Grand Finals, where they beat heavy favorites PSG.LGD 3-2 in what is considered the best TI finals to date. JerAx's impactful support play earned a lot of praise, particularly his Io and Earthshaker performances in the Grand Finals being highlighted.</p>
    <p>Following his greatest achievement to date, JerAx and OG decided to take a longer break post-TI.
    <p>In January 2019, JerAx and his teammates were featured in Valve's True Sight documentary, featuring the Grand Finals of TI8. It was JerAx's second appearance in this series, as he had already featured in the episode about the Kiev Major in 2017.</p></p>
    <p>His return to the top tier of professional Dota proved slow, in part because carry ana had decided to take a longer break and the team was trying out different players as replacement. When their star carry returned to the active roster in March, the results markedly improved. Despite a lack of major championships, a series of good results and high placements in the second half of the season, earned his team a spot at The International 2019, via the Dota Pro Circuit.</p>
    <p>This year, JerAx would not be underestimated at TI. The team breezed through the group stage and once again took the direct route to the Grand Finals, where they easily beat Team Liquid 3-1. JerAx's support play once again stood out, especially his Tiny, which was instrumental in their three victories in the Grand Finals. JerAx would be among the first people to win The International twice.</p>
    <p>Following The International, JerAx and the entire team decided to once again take an extended break from professional Dota for the remainder of the year.</p>
    <p>In January, JerAx shocked the Dota scene by announcing his retirement.[6][7] As reasons, he cited lack of passion for competing in Dota 2 and a desire to pursue another career.</p>
    <p>On January 28th, he was once again featured in Valve's True Sight documentary.</p>

    <p>Johan <span style="color: cyan;">"BigDaddyN0tail"</span> Sundstein (formerly known as BigDaddy) (born October 8, 1993) is an inactive Danish/Faeroese player who is currently on the inactive roster of OG.</p>
    <p>He is the founder of OG.</p>
    <p>Johan was one of the youngest competitive Heroes of Newerth players in the world, where he played the solo mid role. After the switch to Dota 2, Johan took on the support role, becoming well known for his performances as Chen and Wisp. It was during this transition he quickly developed his micromanagement skills, leading to his renowned Meepo play. Despite his age, Johan was the in-game leader of the Fnatic.EU Dota 2 team.[1]</p></p>
    <p>Starting as a casual DotA and then Heroes of Newerth player Johan, at the age of 15, met Jascha “NoVa” Markuse and Tal “Fly” Aizik in-game where they decided to start playing together. The group became an unsponsored side project of Fnatic manager Danijel "StreeT" Remus. After changes in the existing Fnatic HoN roster and the promising performances of Johan and his friends the group merged with Fnatic players Henrik "FreshPro" Hansen and Kalle “Trixi” Saarinen. The new Fnatic squad almost immediately began to achieve wins in online tournaments, and soon after obtained their first LAN victory in DreamHack Winter 2011. Along with his team Johan was able to secure 1st place victories in four consecutive DreamHack events.[2]</p>
    <p>As a result of the decreasing activity in the competitive HoN scene Johan transitioned from Heroes of Newerth to Dota 2 with his team-mates Jascha “NoVa” Markuse, Tal “Fly” Aizik and Adrian "Era" Kryeziu on March 30th 2012, remaining under Fnatic.EU banner. Persevering through a difficult start in the competitive Dota 2 scene Fnatic eventually won the Thor Open 2012 LAN event, and have since consistently placed top positions in many major online and LAN tournaments. In April 2013 Johan and his team were invited to compete at Valve's The International 2013 in Seattle. On the months leading up the event Fnatic participated in a Bootcamp in Belgrade Serbia, and ultimately achieved a top 8 finish in the tournament. On the 27th August 2014 BigDaddy bid farewell to Fnatic and had this to say: “Today I'm leaving Fnatic, this has been my first and only organization to play under, but all good things must come to an end. I would like to thank everyone who has supported me through the years, as long as you're watching I will be playing :)”[3]</p>
    <p>After The International 2014, N0tail and Fly joined up with ex-Natus Vincere players Puppey and Kuroky, as well as s4 to form Team Secret. His stint in this all-star roster was cut short as he left the team in conjunction with the removal of Fly, and he ended up in Cloud 9 for The International 2015. After an admirable effort in the group stage, the roster fell short during the main stage and he decided to form his own roster following the event. Reuniting with Fly, the two players created (monkey) Business, recruiting talent from different backgrounds and regions. The team later on turned into their own organisation, OG.</p>
    <p>OG was N0tail's path to redemption and success alike, with initial success coming at the the Frankfurt Major climbing through the entire lower bracket to take the win against his old team, Team Secret. The season added a second win at a Valve event before The International 2016. At The International 2016 however, the team crumbled during the main stage and the favourites of the tournament were swiftly knocked down to the lower bracket by MVP Phoenix and then knocked out by TNC. The aftermath saw three of his teammates leave the organisation. N0tail rallied together with Fly and once again saw additions from several backgrounds and regions to win two more Valve events prior to The International 2017.</p>
    <p>Despite a slow start during The International 2018's group stage, OG finished fourth and were seeded into the upper bracket of the main event. Considered underdogs during their entire time at the event, OG managed to advance to the grand finals and won the tournament by defeating PSG.LGD in the grand final series with a score of 3–2.[4][5] After winning The International 2018, N0tail was featured in Forbes' 30 under 30 in gaming at the age of 25.[6] The following year, he won The International 2019, making him and OG at the time the first repeat winners of the International.[7][8]</p>
    <p>Despite being inactive from competing since The International 2021, N0tail would clarify during The International 2022 that he is not retired but only taking a break.[9] He would later form a roster called Old G with former teammates Topson and Ceb, the stack did not manage to qualify to DPC 2023 in the first tour, Notail has since noted that at the moment he is not willing to play competitively.[10]</p>

    <h1>9. Ceb</h1>
    <img src="Images/CEB.jpg" alt="Ceb">
    <p>Sébastien <span style="color: cyan;">"Ceb"</span> Debs (formerly known as 7ckngMad) (born May 11, 1992) is a French/Lebanese player who is currently playing for OG.</p>
    <p>He is the co-founder of OG.</p>
    <p>7ckngMad's professional Dota 2 career started with Team Shakira in 2011. The team first gained notability after placing 4th in Dreamhack Winter 2011 and shortly after Sébastien, along with the rest of the team, was picked up by Western Wolves.[1] After only three months with Western Wolves, paved with roster issues, 7ckingmad left the organisation and decided to join a rehash of mTw led by Troels "Synderen" Nielsen.[2][3]</p>
    <p>The new mTw squad managed to win the organisations first tournament and went on to beat Next.kz in the finals of the West Qualifiers for The International 2012, qualifying for the main event. The team continued having success in almost every tournament it took part in, most notably winning DreamHack Summer 2012. Going into The International 2012 the team was considered as one of the top contenders.</p>
    <p>After, what can only be described as a team-wide collapse, 7ckingMad and his team ended up last in their group with a score of 3-11, only taking a game off TongFu, Darer and CompLexity Gaming. Shortly thereafter 7ckngMad, once again accompanied by Sockshka and Funzii, left the team citing "interpersonal issues" and decided to re-form Team Shakira.[4]</p>
    <p>Two months after re-forming Team Shakira four of the players on the team played in ESWC 2012 as Shiba Gaming. With the help of Alexander "CalculuS" Rathcke they finished 3rd place. The players decided to merge with the then MYM, forming a six-man squad where 7ckngMad took the role as coach/manager/stand-in.[5] Shortly after the formation the team decided not to work with MYM and formed DD.Dota instead.</p>
    <p>After only a short while the German player Angelo "THEneNo-" Gonzalez decided to leave the team and 7ckngMad was once again back on the main roster.[6] Following another time of roster stability issues, the team, now featuring Airat "Silent" Gaziev and Artur "Goblak" Kostenko, entered the qualifier for The International 2013. After placing second in the West Qualifier they faced Chinese team RattleSnake in the Wildcard Match. Before the wildcard match the team was signed by Quantic Gaming and therefore entered the tournament as Quantic.</p>
    <p>The wildcard game ended in a heartbreaking fashion for 7ckinMad and his team. After two games the score was tied but RattleSnake managed to take the last two games of the series in a dominating fashion. Rattlesnake managed to eliminate Quantic 3-1 both due to good play from their own team but also misplays from Quantic, with the most famous one being Sockshka stunning a Beastmaster Boar due to a misclick that could otherwise have stunned three enemy heroes.[7] This ended all hopes for 7ckngMad to qualify for the tournament.</p>
    <p>In the following months Quantic slowly lost player after player, starting off with Silent leaving to Team Empire and Goblak joining Virtus.pro.[8][9] After Funzii decided to retire, 7ckngMad and Sockshka revealed that they had already formed a new team outside of the Quantic organisation.[10]</p>
    <p>The new team, featuring 7ckngMad, Sockshka, Mikkel "miGGel" Berg, Adrian "FATA-" Trinks and Brian "MaNia" Strandby, first went under the name DD.Dota for about a month before a new organisation was willing to step in to sponsor the squad. The organisation that ended up signing the team was the French Sigma.[11] Before joining Sigma MaNia decided to retire and was instead replaced by Pascal "paS" Lohmeier.[12] With this new team 7ckngMad had his most success so far by qualifying for several premier tournaments.</p>
    <p>However, Sigma had mixed results at LANs, being able to achieve success at ESWC, Dota 2 Champion's League and Starladder, but having early departures thereafter. Eventually, a last place finish at DreamLeague due to disqualification sealed the team's fate, and 7ckngMad was left to wander around multiple teams.</p>
    <p>After short stints on various teams, 7ckngMad was taken in by Alliance, but the team posted mediocre results. After failing to qualify for The International 2015, the team seemed to be on the road to recovery, with top 4 placings at DreamLeague and joinDota MLG Pro League Season 2. However, it turned out to be for nothing, as an early departure from ESL One Frankfurt 2015 would be 7ckngmad's last tournament with Alliance. After parting ways with Alliance, 7ckngMad began wandering the scene once more.</p>
    <p>7ckngMad progressively lost prominence as an active player, with low placings on Monkey Freedom Fighters and Kaipi. After serving as an analyst at the Shanghai Major, 7ckngMad became OG's coach and was able to once again show his skills through the team's results. As OG's coach, 7ckngMad proceeded to oversee the team's victories and dominance at the Frankfurt, Manila, Boston and Kiev Majors, all of which were won by OG. Following Resolut1on's departure in March 2018, he was a stand-in player until June before officially filling the offlane position for The International 2018 which he eventually won and the eventual The International 2019.</p>
    <p>In 2020, he would step down from the active roster in January before once again returning in July as Sumail departed the team. In 2021, the team would place in the 7-8th position during TI 10, shortly after Ceb announced his formal retirement on November 18, 2021.[13] Despite this, Ceb would play for OG as a last minute stand-in for Misha on position 5 during the Stockholm Major in May 2022, with Misha unable to attend the major and the eventual PGL Arlington Major 2022, Ceb would once again stand-in. After the conclusion of The International 2022, Ceb formed a new team called Old G to compete at DPC 2023. He would play for OG as stand-in in DreamLeague Season 20 and Riyadh Masters 2023.[14][15][16] Ceb rejoined the active roster of OG in July 30, 2023.[17]</p>

    <img src="Images/COLLAPSE.jpg" alt="Collapse">
    <p>Magomed <span style="color: cyan;">"Collapse"</span> Khalilov (born February 25, 2002) is a Russian player who is currently playing for Team Spirit.</p>
    <p>Collapse is from Mahachkala, Dagestan, which is located in southern Russia. He has began playing Dota 2 at a fairly young age of just 13 years old as he heard about the game from some of his friends, but tried to go for a more professional approach only in 2017.</p>
    <p>Magomed was spending a lot of his free time in Dota 2, and because of it he had some troubles with his parents while he was still studying in school so he was playing from PC cafes. When Magomed started playing, his first heroes were Axe, Earthshaker, and Magnus. As time went on, he started to play more and more on the offlane position, which he plays to this day. On 24th August 2017 Collapse managed to reach 6000 MMR and then decided to form an amateur team with his friends, which led him to compete in smaller commercial tournaments and the Russian Esports Cup.</p>
    <p>For about 2 years Collapse did not play in any kind of professional environment up until the point when he got invited into Cascade where he spent 8 months of his life. It was here when his parents started to be more open-minded to their child's hobby as it was the first time he had been paid a salary for his gaming skills.</p>
    <p>In Cascade Magomed started to make a name for himself while playing in different smaller tournaments and also qualifiers for ESL One Los Angeles 2020 & ESL One Birmingham 2020. Even though the team didn't manage to qualify for any of those events, it was easy to spot Collapse's high skill level, which is what Korb3n saw, a coach of Yellow Submarine. He invited Collapse to play in his team alongside Alexander "TORONTOTOKYO" Khertek, Illya "Yatoro" Mulyarchuk & Yaroslav "Miposhka" Naidenov. According to the manager of the team, if Collapse had not been signed he may have quit professional Dota 2 as he had applied to a medical college.</p>
    <p>At the end of year 2020 Team Spirit signed the roster of Yellow Submarine where Collapse showed off his true potential as one of the best offlaners while playing his signature heroes (Mars, Magnus, Timbersaw, etc.). Team Spirit made one roster change which helped them to qualify to WePlay AniMajor where they managed to get to the top 8 of the tournament. And while it wasn't enough DPC points to qualify to The International 2021, Team Spirit played regional qualifiers and won against Team Empire in the finals with a score of 3:2.</p>
